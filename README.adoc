dnf install make linkchecker graphviz
gem install asciidoctor
go get github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/v3/cmd/gomplate

For other platforms, you'll have to figure out the equivalent install steps.

=== Requesting a change

. Run `make docs` to render your changes as HTML in `docs/`. Preview your changes using a browser.
. Run `make all` to re-generate eve	 rything and validate links (link checking takes a minute or two).
. Submit a link:{repo}/pulls[pull-request] with your changes, and a brief description of why you made them. +

The pull request will be discussed and revised before merging using the GitHub review process.
It is OK to request changes that you're are not 100% sure of.
