      description: A UTC value that marks when the log payload was created or, if the creation time is not known, when the log payload was first collected. The “@” prefix denotes a field that is reserved for a particular use. By default, most tools look for “@timestamp” with ElasticSearch.
    - name: hostname
      type: keyword
      description: The name of the host where this log message originated. In a Kubernetes cluster, this is the same as `kubernetes.host`.

      type: ip
      description: The IPv4 address of the source server. Can be an array.
    - name: ipaddr6
      type: ip

      example: "`info`"
      description: |
        The logging level from various sources, including `rsyslog(severitytext property)`, python's logging module, and others.

        The following values come from link:http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l74[`syslog.h`], and are preceded by their http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l51[numeric equivalents]:

        * `0` = `emerg`, system is unusable.
        * `1` = `alert`, action must be taken immediately.
        * `2` = `crit`, critical conditions.
        * `3` = `err`, error conditions.
        * `4` = `warn`, warning conditions.
        * `5` = `notice`, normal but significant condition.
        * `6` = `info`, informational.
        * `7` = `debug`, debug-level messages.

        The two following values are not part of `syslog.h` but are widely used:

        * `8` = `trace`, trace-level messages, which are more verbose than `debug` messages.
        * `9` = `unknown`, when the logging system gets a value it doesn't recognize.

        Map the log levels or priorities of other logging systems to their nearest match in the preceding list. For example, from link:https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html#logging-levels[python logging], you can match `CRITICAL` with `crit`, `ERROR` with `err`, and so on.
    - name: pid
      type: keyword
      description: The process ID of the logging entity, if available.
    - name: service
      type: keyword
      description: The name of the service associated with the logging entity, if available. For example, syslog's `APP-NAME` and rsyslog's `programname` properties are mapped to the service field.
    - name: tags
      type: text
      doc_values: false
      index: true
      analyzer: whitespace
      description: Optional. An operator-defined list of tags placed on each log by the collector or normalizer. The payload can be a string with whitespace-delimited string tokens or a JSON list of string tokens.
    - name: file
      type: text
      index: true
      doc_values: false
      description: The path to the log file from which the collector read this log entry. Normally, this is a path in the `/var/log` file system of a cluster node.
      norms: true
    - name: offset
      type: long
      description: The offset value. Can represent bytes to the start of the log line in the file (zero- or one-based), or log line numbers (zero- or one-based), so long as the values are strictly monotonically increasing in the context of a single log file. The values are allowed to wrap, representing a new version of the log file (rotation).

      description: 'Associate this record with the namespace that has this name. This value is not stored, it is only used to associate the record with the appropriate namespace for access control and visualization. Usually, this value is given in the tag, but if the protocol does not support sending a tag, this namespace_name field can be used. If the `namespace_name` field is present, it overrides the namespace given in the tag or in `kubernetes.namespace_name`. The format is the same as the one used by Kubernetes namespace names. See also `namespace_uuid`.

    - name: namespace_uuid
      private: true
      type: keyword
      example: "`82f13a8e-882a-4344-b103-f0a6f30fd218`"

      description: 'The UUID associated with the `namespace_name`. This value is not stored. It is only used to associate the record with the appropriate namespace for access control and visualization. If this field is present, it overrides the UUID given in kubernetes.namespace_uuid, and causes the Kubernetes metadata lookup to be skipped for this log record.

      description: A unique ID assigned to each message. The format is not specified. It may be a UUID or a Base64, or some other ASCII value. This is currently generated by https://github.com/uken/fluent-plugin-elasticsearch/tree/v1.13.2#generate-hash-id and is used as the `_id` of the document in Elasticsearch. The intended use of this field is that if you use another logging store or application other than Elasticsearch, but you still need to correlate data with the data stored in Elasticsearch, this field will give you the exact document corresponding to the record.

        For Elasticsearch 6.x and later, this is a name of a write index alias. The value depends on the log type of this message. Detailed documentation is found at https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/cluster-logging/cluster-logging-es-rollover-data-design.md#data-model.

        For Elasticsearch 5.x and earlier, this is the index name by which this message will be stored in Elasticsearch. The value of this field is generated based on the source of the message. Example of the value is 'project.my-cool-project-in-lab04.748e92c2-70d7-11e9-b387-000d3af2d83b.2019.05.09'.
