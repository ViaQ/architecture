== Observability and Correlation

Observability means collecting, forwarding, storing, analyzing and _correlating_  different types of _signal_ from a cluster to  monitor its health, identify and fix problems, and plan for capacity changes.

=== Types of signal

Log entry:: A block of text (usually one line) written by application or infrastructure processes, annotated by the logging system and forwarded for further processing.

Metric:: A statistic that changes over time and is sampled to produce a _time_series_. Presently we can assue all metrics are in  https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] format, and are sampled by Prometheus. Processes to be monitored must provide a HTTP "scrape endpoint" where the metrics can be read.

Alert::: Alerts are not primary signals but summaries of  metric time series. They identify conditions that need attention.

Trace:: Data attached to request-response _scopes_ to track the progress and outcome of a request. Trace context can follow a chain of requests from server to server, provided the servers co-operate in passing the trace context.

=== Correlation Points

Correlation means associating different types of signal, for example:

* I have an alert saying that an application is in trouble.
  I want to see logs from that application around the time of the alert.
* I have a log entry showing that a request failed.
  I want to see traces for the entire life-cycle of that request and dependent requests.

Correlation requires that the signals have data that can be matched, for example:

[horizontal]
timestamp:: All signals carry a timestamp. Signals can always be correlated by time-interval.

origin resource:: Many signals are associated with a _resource_.
Resource signals can be correlated by `cluster`, `namespace`, `pod` and `node`
The logging system, kubelet metrics and https://observatorium.io/[observatorium metrics]
footnote:[Do all observatorium metrics provide this?]
provide this information.

trace-id:: Trace signals carry a trace-id.
Applications that support tracing should include trace-id in an identifiable way in their logs.
footnote:[How many applications do this? Are there standards for trace-id format in logs?]
Metrics can't carry trace-ids due to cardinality limitations.

WARNING: Traces need more research.

That names and formats of correlation fields or labels are not uniform across signals.
     https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] does define a reference data-model for all signal types but
it is not compatible with the current naming schemes of Openshift Logging, Monitoring or Telemetry,
or Kubernetes.

The data model we currently use is:

* link:../data_model/public/data_model.html[Openshift Logging]
*  Metrics: _TODO_ Openshift and Kubernetes have consistent labels and naming schemes.
*  Traces: _TODO_

* https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/datamodel.md[Metrics]

=== Correlation Stories

* On receiving an alert, I want to see correlated logs or traces.
* On reading a log, I want to see correlated traces or metrics.
* On following a trace, I want to see correlated logs or metrics.
* I want to query for a report on (logs/metrics/traces) and have correlated signals included as well.
